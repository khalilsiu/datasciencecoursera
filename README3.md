We go hideaway in daylight
We go undercover when under sun
Got a secret side in plain sight
Where the streets are empty
That’s where we run
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can’t be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
We could be
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
Anybody’s got the power
They don’t see it
'Cause they don’t understand
Spin around and round for hours
You and me we got the world in our hands
Everyday people do
Everyday things but I
Can’t be one of them
I know you hear me now
We are a different kind
We can do anything
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be heroes
We could be heroes
Me and you
We could be
We could be
We could be
We could be
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
We could be
Ooh ooh ooh
We could be
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
(We could be)
All we're looking for is love and a little light
Love and a little light
We could be heroes (Oh)
We could be heroes (Oh)
Me and you
We could be heroes (Oh)
We could be heroes (Oh)
Me and you
We could be (Ooh)
We could be (Ooh)
We could be (Ooh)
We could be (Ooh)
We could be
